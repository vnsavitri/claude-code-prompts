**Prompts tell your agent how to behave. [RepoWise](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise) tells it what the codebase actually does.**

Open-source codebase intelligence engine. Auto-generated architecture wikis, dependency graphs, ownership maps, dead code detection, and 9 MCP tools your AI editor can query in real time.

## Claude Code System Prompts


**Every prompt in this repo is independently authored.** We did not copy Anthropic's text. We observed what patterns make a coding agent reliable and wrote our own versions. From the team behind [RepoWise](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise).

## Quick Start

1. Browse the [pattern files](#prompt-engineering-patterns) to understand how production coding agents structure their prompts.
2. Copy any [complete prompt](#claude-code-system-prompt-1) into your own agent configuration.
3. Replace `{{PLACEHOLDER}}` values with your stack, tool names, and risk policy.
4. For Cursor IDE users, drop `skills/` into `~/.cursor/skills-cursor/` for instant integration.
5. Add codebase context with [RepoWise](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise) so your agent actually understands the project it's working in.

## Methodology

We studied the prompting patterns used by Claude Code in practice. We identified the behavioral rules, safety patterns, tool-routing strategies, and multi-agent coordination approaches it employs. We then independently authored every prompt in this repository from scratch, implementing the same patterns in our own words.

No text was copied from Anthropic's codebase. All content is original.

## Pair With RepoWise for Full-Stack Agent Intelligence

The prompts in this repo handle agent behavior: safety, tool routing, delegation, verification. But behavior without context is like a senior engineer who's never seen the codebase. [RepoWise](https://github.com/repowise-dev/repowise) fills that gap.

| What you get | How it helps your agent |
|---|---|
| Architecture wiki | Agent understands module boundaries before making changes |
| Dependency graphs | Agent traces impact of changes across packages |
| Ownership tracking | Agent knows which team/person owns each module |
| Dead code detection | Agent avoids modifying unused code paths |
| 9 MCP tools | Agent queries project knowledge directly from Cursor, Claude Code, or any MCP-compatible editor |

Works with any language, any repo size.

## Contributing

- All additions must be original writing. No verbatim vendor prompt text.
- Prefer concise, implementation-ready language over theory.
- Every new pattern file must include at least one concrete template.
- Follow section conventions: `Approach / Output / Constraints` for agents, `Include / Format / Constraints` for memory, `Rules / Format` for utilities.
